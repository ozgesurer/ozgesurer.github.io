- title: "Sequential Bayesian experimental design for calibration of expensive simulation models"
  image: eivar_cs.png
  description: >
    Simulation models of critical systems often have parameters that need to be calibrated using observed data. 
    For expensive simulation models, calibration is done using an emulator of the simulation model built on simulation 
    output at different parameter settings. Using intelligent and adaptive selection of parameters to build the emulator 
    can drastically improve the efficiency of the calibration process. The article proposes a sequential framework with 
    a novel criterion for parameter selection that targets learning the posterior density of the parameters. 
    The emergent behavior from this criterion is that exploration happens by selecting parameters in uncertain posterior 
    regions while simultaneously exploitation happens by selecting parameters in regions of high posterior density. 
    The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated using several simulation experiments and a nuclear physics reaction model.

- title: "Discovering interpretable structure in longitudinal predictors via coefficient trees"
  image: long_tree.png
  description: >
   We consider the regression setting in which the response variable is not longitudinal (i.e., it is observed once for each case), 
   but it is assumed to depend functionally on a set of predictors that are observed longitudinally, which is a specific form of 
   functional predictors. In this situation, we often expect that the same predictor observed at nearby time points are more 
   likely to be associated with the response in the same way. In such situations, we can exploit those aspects and discover groups 
   of predictors that share the same (or similar) coefficient according to their temporal proximity. We propose a new algorithm 
   called coefficient tree regression for data in which the non-longitudinal response depends on longitudinal predictors to efficiently 
   discover the underlying temporal characteristics of the data. The approach results in a simple and highly interpretable tree 
   structure from which the hierarchical relationships between groups of predictors that affect the response in a similar manner 
   based on their temporal proximity can be observed, and we demonstrate with a real example that it can provide a clear and concise 
   interpretation of the data. In numerical comparisons over a variety of examples, we show that our approach achieves substantially 
   better predictive accuracy than existing competitors, most likely due to its inherent form of dimensionality reduction that is 
   automatically discovered when fitting the model, in addition to having interpretability advantages and lower computational expense.

- title: "Bayesian calibration of viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions"
  image: VAH_shear.png
  description: >
    Due to large pressure gradients at early times, standard hydrodynamic model simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions 
    do not become reliable until O(1)fm/c after the collision. To address this one often introduces a pre-hydrodynamic stage that
    models the early evolution microscopically, typically as a conformal, weakly interacting gas. In such an approach the transition
    from the pre-hydrodynamic to the hydrodynamic stage is discontinuous, introducing considerable theoretical model ambiguity. 
    Alternatively, fluids with large anisotropic pressure gradients can be handled macroscopically using the recently developed 
    Viscous Anisotropic Hydrodynamics (VAH). In high-energy heavy-ion collisions VAH is applicable already at very early times, 
    and at later times transitions smoothly into conventional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH). We present a Bayesian calibration
    of the VAH model with experimental data for Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC. We find that the VAH model has the unique capability of 
    constraining the specific viscosities of the QGP at higher temperatures than other previously used models.

- title: "Coefficient tree regression: fast, accurate and interpretable predictive modeling"
  image: ctr_tree.png
  description: >
    The proliferation of data collection technologies often results in large data sets with many observations and many variables. 
    In practice, highly relevant engineered features are often groups of predictors that share a common regression coefficient 
    (i.e., the predictors in the group affect the response only via their collective sum), where the groups are unknown in advance 
    and must be discovered from the data. We propose an algorithm called coefficient tree regression (CTR) to discover the group 
    structure and fit the resulting regression model. In this regard CTR is an automated way of engineering new features, each of 
    which is the collective sum of the predictors within each group. The algorithm can be used when the number of variables is larger 
    than, or smaller than, the number of observations. Creating new features that affect the response in a similar manner improves 
    predictive modeling, especially in domains where the relationships between predictors are not known a priori. CTR borrows 
    computational strategies from both linear regression (fast model updating when adding/modifying a feature in the model) and 
    regression trees (fast partitioning to form and split groups) to achieve outstanding computational and predictive performance. 
    Finding features that represent hidden groups of predictors (i.e., a hidden ontology) that impact the response only via their 
    sum also has major interpretability advantages, which we demonstrate with a real data example of predicting political affiliations 
    with television viewing habits. In numerical comparisons over a variety of examples, we demonstrate that both computational expense 
    and predictive performance are far superior to existing methods that create features as groups of predictors. Moreover, CTR has 
    overall predictive performance that is comparable to or slightly better than the regular lasso method, which we include as a 
    reference benchmark for comparison even though it is non-group-based, in addition to having substantial computational and interpretive 
    advantages over lasso.

- title: "Coefficient tree regression for generalized linear models"
  image: 10pieces.eps
  description: >
    Large regression data sets are now commonplace, with so many predictors that they cannot or should not all be included individually. 
    In practice, derived predictors are relevant as meaningful features or, at the very least, as a form of regularized approximation of 
    the true coefficients. We consider derived predictors that are the sum of some groups of individual predictors, which is equivalent 
    to predictors within a group sharing the same coefficient. However, the groups of predictors are usually not known in advance and 
    must be discovered from the data. In this paper we develop a coefficient tree regression algorithm for generalized linear models to 
    discover the group structure from the data. The approach results in simple and highly interpretable models, and we demonstrated with 
    real examples that it can provide a clear and concise interpretation of the data. Via simulation studies under different scenarios we 
    showed that our approach performs better than existing competitors in terms of computing time and predictive accuracy.

- title: "Design of COVID-19 staged alert systems to ensure healthcare capacity with minimal closures"
  image: austin_ToIHT_CC.pdf
  description: >
    Community mitigation strategies to combat COVID-19, ranging from healthy hygiene to shelter-in-place orders, exact substantial socioeconomic costs. 
    Judicious implementation and relaxation of restrictions amplify their public health benefits while reducing costs. We derive optimal 
    strategies for toggling between mitigation stages using daily COVID-19 hospital admissions. With public compliance, the policy triggers 
    ensure adequate intensive care unit capacity with high probability while minimizing the duration of strict mitigation measures. 
    In comparison, we show that other sensible COVID-19 staging policies, including France’s ICU-based thresholds and a widely adopted 
    indicator for reopening schools and businesses, require overly restrictive measures or trigger strict stages too late to avert 
    catastrophic surges. As proof-of-concept, we describe the optimization and maintenance of the staged alert system that has guided 
    COVID-19 policy in a large US city (Austin, Texas) since May 2020. As cities worldwide face future pandemic waves, our findings 
    provide a robust strategy for tracking COVID-19 hospital admissions as an early indicator of hospital surges and enacting staged 
    measures to ensure integrity of the health system, safety of the health workforce, and public confidence.
