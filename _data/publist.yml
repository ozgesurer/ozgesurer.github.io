  description: >
    Simulation models of critical systems often have parameters that need to be calibrated using observed data. 
    For expensive simulation models, calibration is done using an emulator of the simulation model built on simulation 
    output at different parameter settings. Using intelligent and adaptive selection of parameters to build the emulator 
    can drastically improve the efficiency of the calibration process. The article proposes a sequential framework with 
    a novel criterion for parameter selection that targets learning the posterior density of the parameters. 
    The emergent behavior from this criterion is that exploration happens by selecting parameters in uncertain posterior 
    regions while simultaneously exploitation happens by selecting parameters in regions of high posterior density. 
    The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated using several simulation experiments and a nuclear physics reaction model.

- title: "Discovering interpretable structure in longitudinal predictors via coefficient trees"
  image: bestworstresponse6.png
  description: >
   We consider the regression setting in which the response variable is not longitudinal (i.e., it is observed once for each case), 
   but it is assumed to depend functionally on a set of predictors that are observed longitudinally, which is a specific form of 
   functional predictors. In this situation, we often expect that the same predictor observed at nearby time points are more 
   likely to be associated with the response in the same way. In such situations, we can exploit those aspects and discover groups 
   of predictors that share the same (or similar) coefficient according to their temporal proximity. We propose a new algorithm 
   called coefficient tree regression for data in which the non-longitudinal response depends on longitudinal predictors to efficiently 
   discover the underlying temporal characteristics of the data. The approach results in a simple and highly interpretable tree 
   structure from which the hierarchical relationships between groups of predictors that affect the response in a similar manner 
   based on their temporal proximity can be observed, and we demonstrate with a real example that it can provide a clear and concise 
   interpretation of the data. In numerical comparisons over a variety of examples, we show that our approach achieves substantially 
   better predictive accuracy than existing competitors, most likely due to its inherent form of dimensionality reduction that is 
   automatically discovered when fitting the model, in addition to having interpretability advantages and lower computational expense.

- title: "Bayesian calibration of viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions"
  image: bestworstresponse6.png
  description: >
    Due to large pressure gradients at early times, standard hydrodynamic model simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions 
    do not become reliable until O(1)fm/c after the collision. To address this one often introduces a pre-hydrodynamic stage that
    models the early evolution microscopically, typically as a conformal, weakly interacting gas. In such an approach the transition
    from the pre-hydrodynamic to the hydrodynamic stage is discontinuous, introducing considerable theoretical model ambiguity. 
    Alternatively, fluids with large anisotropic pressure gradients can be handled macroscopically using the recently developed 
    Viscous Anisotropic Hydrodynamics (VAH). In high-energy heavy-ion collisions VAH is applicable already at very early times, 
    and at later times transitions smoothly into conventional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH). We present a Bayesian calibration
    of the VAH model with experimental data for Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC. We find that the VAH model has the unique capability of 
    constraining the specific viscosities of the QGP at higher temperatures than other previously used models.
