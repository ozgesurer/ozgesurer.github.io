    I am excited to serve as a Guest Editor for an upcoming Special Issue of IISE Transactions 
    focused on Data Science for Computational Modeling (DSCM). This issue aims to highlight 
    cutting-edge research at the intersection of data science, high-fidelity simulations, 
    and decision-making under uncertainty. For researchers working at the frontiers of 
    data-driven modeling, this is an exciting opportunity to contribute to a high-impact venue. 
    We look forward to your submissions!

    I am honored to collaborate on this special issue with the following fellow Guest Editors: 
    Rui Tuo (Texas A&M University), Xinwei Deng (Virginia Tech), 
    Lulu Kang (University of Massachusetts), and Xiao Liu (Georgia Institute of Technology).

    The Call for Papers is available <a href="https://github.com/ozgesurer/ozgesurer.github.io/tree/master/files/IISE_Trans_CFP_Special_Issue_on_DSCM.pdf">here</a>.

    I was invited to participate in the workshop *Toward Next-Generation Ecosystems for Scientific Computing*, 
    held in Chicago. The event brought together researchers and developers to discuss 
    emerging challenges and opportunities in building sustainable, scalable scientific computing infrastructures.

    I was invited to the BAND-Nuclear Data Workshop to meet with scientists interested in 
    applying statistical learning techniques to physics models. I presented on novel 
    computer experiment design approaches and their implementation in our Python package, PUQ. 
    A list of presentations from the workshop, along with PDFs of some of the slides, can be found

    Moses Chan and I co-organized a two-part session at the INFORMS Annual Meeting, Seattle, 2024.  
    The sessions titled "Computational/Statistical Methods for Uncertainty Quantification" covered 
    a range of emulation and calibration strategies in tackling searches in high-dimensional parameter space, 
    stochastic simulation data, computationally effective design constructions, multi-fidelity experiments, and more.  
    Some of the presented works can be found via <a href="https://tinyurl.com/informs2024UQ">this post</a>.
