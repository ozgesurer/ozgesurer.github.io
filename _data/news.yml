    I was invited to the BAND-Nuclear Data Workshop to meet with scientists interested in 
    applying statistical learning techniques to physics models. I presented on novel 
    computer experiment design approaches and their implementation in our Python package, PUQ. 
    A list of presentations from the workshop, along with PDFs of some of the slides, can be found

    Moses Chan and I co-organized a two-part session at the INFORMS Annual Meeting, Seattle, 2024.  
    The sessions titled "Computational/Statistical Methods for Uncertainty Quantification" covered 
    a range of emulation and calibration strategies in tackling searches in high-dimensional parameter space, 
    stochastic simulation data, computationally effective design constructions, multi-fidelity experiments, and more.  
    Some of the presented works can be found via <a href="https://tinyurl.com/informs2024UQ">this post</a>.
