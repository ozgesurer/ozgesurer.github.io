I am an Assistant Professor of [Analytics at Miami University](https://www.miamioh.edu/fsb/academics/isa/). I graduated with a PhD degree from the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/).

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of statistics and machine learning to analyze and develop tools for learning from large data sets. My doctoral work focuses on designing interpretable predictive models to discover the group structure from data, and their interdisciplinary applications. In addition, I develop tools and techniques relying on Bayesian statistical learning to predict the future behavior of physical systems with well-quantified uncertainties.
